This project presents a Power BI dashboard for analyzing customer churn in an Internet Service Provider (ISP) company. The dashboard provides insights into various factors influencing customer retention and churn rates.

## Key Findings

2. **Contract Length and Tenure**: Customers with monthly contracts and shorter tenure are more likely to churn.

3. **Dependents and Partners**: Customers without dependents or partners show a higher propensity to churn.

4. **Demographics**: While gender doesn't significantly impact churn, senior citizens are less likely to leave compared to non-senior citizens.

5. **Internet Service Type**: Fiber Optic internet service users have a higher churn rate compared to other service types.

6. **Payment Method**: Electronic check is the most common payment method among churned customers.

7. **Additional Services**: Customers not receiving Tech Support, Device Protection, or Online Security services are more likely to be dissatisfied and churn.
